# SubstringHashSwift

# Program to find an 8-letter substring within a string that produces a given hash solution. Written in Swift as part of my job application for the iOS Developer position at Trello.

# Read the problem description in the .png file first, before looking at my code, if you want to give it a shot before you see the solution

# The Trello Playground is the solution without the UI, and the TrelloJobApplication is the solution as an iOS app

# I didnâ€™t get the job, but I get an HR screen and got through the 1st round of technical interviews with this program, so I must have done something right. :)
